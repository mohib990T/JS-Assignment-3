    <h1>JS Assignment-3</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>1. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>var :-
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared with var are in the function scope.</li>
        <li>We can declare var variables after defining them.</li>
        <li>We can define new values to the var variables</li>
        <li>We allowed to declare the same variable again.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>let :-
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared with let are in the block scope.</li>
        <li>let variables do not support hoisting.</li>
        <li>We can define new values to the let variables</li>
        <li>let variables do not allow you to redeclare them again.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>const :-
    <ol>
        <li>Variables declared with const are in the block scope.</li>
        <li>const variables do not support hoisting.</li>
        <li>const variables value cannot be reassigned.</li>
        <li>const variables do not allow you to redeclare them again.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>2. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use ?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>undefined :- Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. <br>
        null : - Null means an empty value or a blank value. And we use the null when if we want print the value
        at the particular time or event.</p>
    <h2>3. What is use of prompt in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>The JavaScript window. prompt() is a built-in function that is used to display a dialog box that asks the user to
        input some text. This pop-up box will appear and takes user input before entering the web page. It waits until
        the user enters any value in the text box or we can also cancel the dialog box.</p>

    <h2>4. Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language? Write the Code for all Data types.</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value
        they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them <br>
        There are two type of datatypes present in Javascript. <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Primitive Data Type</li>
        <li>Non-primitive
            Data Type</li>
    </ol> <br>
    Primitive Datatype consist of 5 different data type named -
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Number :- let a = 123;</li>
        <li>String :- let b = "Hey Javascript"</li>
        <li>Boolean :- let c = true/false;</li>
        <li>Undefined :- let d;</li>
        <li>Null :- let e = null;</li>
    </ol>
    <br>Non-primitive datatype consist of 3 different data type named -
    <ol>
        <li>Object :- {key : value}</li>
        <li>Array :- [12, 34, 56]</li>
        <li>Function :- function fun(){}</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

        There are different types of JavaScript operators: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment Operators</li>
        <li>Comparison Operators</li>
        <li>Logical Operators</li>
        <li>Conditional Operators</li>
        <li>Type Operators</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>6. Explain the Assignment Operator.</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>An assignment operator is basically a binary operator that helps in modifying the variable to its left with the
        use of the value to its right. We utilize the assignment operators to transform and assign values to any
        variables.</p>
    <h2>7. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>An arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them.
        They are used in common arithmetic and most computer languages contain a set of such operators that can be used
        within equations to perform a number of types of sequential calculation. <br>
        There are the 5 arithmetic operations -
    <ol>
        <li>Addition (+) Adds one operand to the other</li>
        <li>Subtraction (-) Subtracts the second operand from the first</li>
        <li>Multiplication (*) Multiplies one operand by the other</li>
        <li>Division (/) Divides the first operand by the second</li>
        <li>Modulo (%) Divides the first integer operand by the second, and returns the remainder</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>8. What are the Binary Operators in js</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands and manipulates them to return a result. Binary
        operators are presented in the form: Operand1, Operator, Operand2<br>Some common binary operators
        in computing include: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Equal (==)</li>
        <li>Not equal (!=)</li>
        <li>Less than (<)< /li>
        <li>Greater than (>)</li>
        <li>Greater than or equal to (>=)</li>
        <li>Less than or equal to (<=) </li>
        <li>Logical AND (&&)</li>
        <li>Logical OR (||)</li>
        <li>Addition (+)</li>
        <li>Subtraction (-)</li>
        <li>Multiplication (*)</li>
        <li>Divide (/)</li>
        <li>Modulo (%)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>9. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p>Pre-increment (++i) - Before assigning the value to the variable, the value is incremented by one. <br>
        Ex :- let x = 3;<br>
        let y = ++x; <br>
        console.log(x) //it will give output 4 <br>
        console.log(y) //it will give output 4. <br>


        Post-increment (i++) - After assigning the value to the variable, the value is incremented. <br>
        Ex :- let x =3;<br>
        let y = x++; <br>
        console.log(x) //it will give output 4 <br>
        console.log(y) //it will give output 3
    </p>
    <h2>10. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
    <p style="color: blue;">Ans :-</p>
    <p> The "==" operator is the comparison operator. It will only return true if both values are equivalent after
        checking their types
        to the same type. <br>
        The "===" operator is a more strict comparison operator often called the identity operator. It will only
        return true if both the type and value of the operands are the same.</p>
